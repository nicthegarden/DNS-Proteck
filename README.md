[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

This is the script that will let you block all the DNS and program that could be a little bit fishy and that were targeted as a threat over on the internet.

This is quite simple , it gets the DNS and put a value into you hostfile by updating it directly.


The Exe is a ps1 file converted to be added on a task scheduler in Windows to simplify usage of the script.
